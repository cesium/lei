request is a POST method and its body should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "exchange_requests": [
    {
      "id": "a1",
      "from_shift_id": "TP1",
      "to_shift_id": "TP5",
      "created_at": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "a2",
      "from_shift_id": "TP5",
      "to_shift_id": "TP1",
      "created_at": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "a3",
      "from_shift_id": "TP2",
      "to_shift_id": "TP4",
      "created_at": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

The return is a JSON as the following:

```json
{
  "solved_exchanges": [
    "a1",
    "a2"
  ]
}
```
